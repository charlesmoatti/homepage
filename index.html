        Physicist and Engineer with broad multidisciplinary experience in software engineering, embedded systems, and machine learning. Passionate about diving into new topics and learning new skills, I enjoy tackling complex challenges and delivering efficient solutions.
        <p>
          Having completed my bachelor's degree in physics (BSc. Honors Physics) from Mcgill University. I pursued
          with a masters in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (MSc. Quantum Engineering) at the ETH Zürich. Learning about computers, from the in and out,
          programming, software engineering and machine learning culminating in my master thesis in computer
          vision at the Kinderspital Zürich. During my academic career, I am proud to have contributed to several research projects resulting in multiple peer-reviewed journal publications in neuroscience, GPS technologies and radio astronomy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, I joined SUMEX AG in Zürich, as a software engineer, where I design, implement and maintain claims processing software systems for the Swiss healthcare sector. There, I serve as a technical lead for several backend features, while contributing to frontend and architectural design. Backend development is done in Java and Spring, while frontend development is done in Angular.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my freetime, I enjoy spending time in the mountains, whether hiking, ski-touring or trail running, doing all kind of sports and also enjoy playing piano, singing and guitar. I have completed several long-distance cycling trips spanning thousands of kilometers, and I am truly passionate about the outdoors and geography. My next objective is to ski tour the Haute Route in the Alps.
